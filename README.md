## What is linear regression?
Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the unknown data value by using another known, related data value.

Mathematically models the unknown or dependent variable and the known or independent variable as a linear equation.

## Why is linear regression important?
Linear regression models are relatively simple and provide an easy-to-interpret mathematical formula for generating predictions.

Linear regression is an established statistical technique.
Businesses use it to reliably and predictably convert raw data to predict future trends.

## How does linear regression work?
In essence, a simple linear regression technique attempts to plot a line graph between two data variables, x and y.

As the independent variable, x is plotted along the horizontal axis.

Independent variables are also called explanatory variables or predictor variables.

The dependent variable, y, is plotted on the vertical axis.

You can also refer to the y-values as response variables or predicted variables.

There must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

To determine this relationship, data scientists create a scatter plot (a random collection of x and y values) to see if they fall along a straight line.
